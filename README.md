# Commit Hook: Automatic Ticket Prefixer

This commit hook script automatically prefixes your commit messages with a ticket identifier extracted from your current Git branch name. If your branch name follows a specific ticket format (e.g., `feature/ABC-123` or simply `ABC-123`), the script extracts the ticket number and prepends it to your commit message in square brackets.

## How It Works

1. **Extract Branch Name**  
   The script retrieves the current branch name using:
   ```bash
   git symbolic-ref --short HEAD
   ```

2. **Match Ticket Identifier**  
   A regular expression is used to capture the ticket from the branch name:
   ```bash
   TICKET_PATTERN='^(.*\/)?([A-Za-z]+-[0-9]+)'
   ```
   - This pattern optionally matches any prefix ending with a slash.
   - It captures the ticket identifier (e.g., `ABC-123`) in the second capture group.

3. **Format the Ticket**  
   If a valid ticket is found, it is converted to uppercase:
   ```bash
   TICKET_NAME=$(echo "$TICKET_NAME" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')
   ```

4. **Prepend to Commit Message**  
   The ticket identifier is prepended in square brackets to the first line of the commit message using:
   ```bash
   sed -i.bak -e "1s/^/[$TICKET_NAME] /" $COMMIT_MSG_FILE
   ```

## Installation

1. **Save the Script**  
   Place the script in your repositoryâ€™s `.git/hooks` directory with the filename `commit-msg`.

2. **Make It Executable**  
   Grant execution permissions by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
   ```

## Customization

- **Regex Pattern:**  
  Adjust the `TICKET_PATTERN` variable if your branch naming convention is different.

- **Prefix Format:**  
  By default, the ticket is wrapped in square brackets. Modify the `sed` command if you prefer a different format.

## Example

- **Branch Name:** `feature/XYZ-456`  
- **Original Commit Message:**
  ```
  Fix issue with user login
  ```
- **Modified Commit Message:**
  ```
  [XYZ-456] Fix issue with user login
  ```

## Limitations

- The hook only prefixes the commit message if a valid ticket identifier is detected in the branch name.
- If no ticket is found, the commit message remains unchanged.

This commit hook helps maintain consistency by automatically linking commit messages to their corresponding tickets, making it easier to track changes related to specific tasks.
